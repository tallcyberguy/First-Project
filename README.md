# Cyber Security HomeLab-Project
My aim is to imitate as a red teamer and detect as a blue teamer.That's the reason for this project.
I used vmwarepro to set-up my homelab.
Homelab includes:
   Kali Linux /n
   WinServer 2019 /n
   WinClient /n
   Security Onion /n
   Metasploitable /n
   Firewall (Pfsense) /n
   Active Directory /n
   Group policies etc /n


Start of the project

Firstly I followed the cyberwoxacademys instructions to set-up the firewall for my homelab.

-Created virtual machine for PFSense and configured it according to the instructions. /n
-Downloaded Security Onion from https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/VERIFY_ISO.md /n
