# Cyber Security HomeLab-Project
My aim is to imitate as a red teamer and detect as a blue teamer.That's the reason for this project.
I used vmwarepro to set-up my homelab.

Homelab includes:
  1 Kali Linux
  2 WinServer 2019
  3 WinClient
  4 Security Onion
  5 Metasploitable
  6 Firewall (Pfsense)




Also Ä± wanna add a load balancer, WAF,open-source EDR
