# Cyber Security HomeLab-Project
My aim is to imitate as a red teamer and detect as a blue teamer.That's the reason for this project.
I used vmwarepro to set-up my homelab.
Homelab includes:
   Kali Linux /n
   WinServer 2019
   WinClient
   Security Onion
   Metasploitable
   Firewall (Pfsense)
   Active Directory
   Group policies etc


Start of the project

Firstly I followed the cyberwoxacademys instructions to set-up the firewall for my homelab.
-Downloaded PFSense iso from https://www.pfsense.org/download/
-Created virtual machine for PFSense and configured it according to the instructions.
-Downloaded Security Onion from https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion/blob/master/VERIFY_ISO.md
-Installed SecOnion
-Set up an ubuntu machine to use SecOnion tools as an Analyst does.
